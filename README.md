# FLASH-USDT-TRC20
# Flash USDT Software

**Flash USDT Software** is a powerful crypto simulation tool that instantly displays a programmable USDT balance in any ERC-20 or TRC-20 wallet. The balance is fully functional — transferable, swappable, and visible on blockchain explorers — and auto-expires after a set time (60–365 days).

Ideal for developers, OTC desks, escrow agents, and DeFi testers, this tool enables wallet credibility and simulations without putting real capital at risk.

## What is Flash USDT?

Flash USDT is a **synthetic, time-bound asset layer** designed to mimic the behavior of real USDT on major blockchain networks. When deployed using the official Flash USDT Software, wallets instantly reflect a functional USDT balance, which self-destructs after the configured period — with no on-chain residue.

Built on a proprietary dual-engine architecture (`FLACH USDT` + `USDT FLACH`), it offers lightning-fast balance simulation, no private key access, zero gas fees, and no confirmation delays.
